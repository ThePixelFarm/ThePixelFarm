## 👋 Hi, I’m @ThePixelFarm

Welcome to the future of **sustainability** and **blockchain**! I’m building something **different** — an **Ecological Egg Farm** powered by **crypto** and **NFTs**. It’s a space where the world of agriculture and the world of digital assets meet. 🌱🐣

### What am I working on?
Right now, I’m focused on creating a **business plan** for a one-of-a-kind farm that merges **blockchain** with real-world farming. I want to show that **blockchain** isn’t just a buzzword — it’s the future of how businesses operate and grow. 🚀

### Areas of Interest:
